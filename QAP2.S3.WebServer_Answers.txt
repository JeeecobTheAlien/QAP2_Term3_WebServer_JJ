1. How many hours did it take you to complete this assessment? 11 Hours started doing it one way and then changed my whole game plan after spending 3 hours doing so!

2. What online resources you have used? W3School

3. Did you need to ask any of your friends in solving the problems. Negative

4. Did you need to ask questions to any of your instructors? Negative

5. Rate (subjectively) the difficulty of each question from your own perspective, and whether you feel confident that you can solve a similar but different problem requiring some of the same techniques in the future now that youâ€™ve completed this one.
 the questions themselves werent overely difficult after reading over the qap 4 times and having an Ai read the entire qap to me twice given that info I'd have to grade the problems itself a 7/10 1 being easy 10 being difficult, and the reading portion being a 8.5/10!
